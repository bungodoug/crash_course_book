# crash_course_book
exercises from the pythin crash course book
i extracted the read a classic script from all the other stuff in the CCIP project, because:
a) i want to start to use github as my main repository for all scripts
b) the read a classic script is probably the first code that is 'decent' has some commercial merit to it.
c) improve the script, via branching. commits, pull requests etc to improve my competence and familiarity with github.
In the fullness of time some of these better scripts could act as a portfolio for me as i try and secure contract work
